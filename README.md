## Project Description
This project recreates a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper front page using only HTML. 
The layout was designed to resemble a traditional printed newspaper, including masthead, multi-column articles, headlines, images, and side investigation sections. 
The focus was on proper semantic structure, visual hierarchy, and authentic newspaper-style formatting without using external CSS or JavaScript.

## Features Implemented
- HTML5 semantic structure (`header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Multi-column newspaper layout using `column-count`
- 3-column table layout for aligned images and side story
- Floating elements for traditional newspaper header design
- Inline CSS styling for complete self-contained layout
- Proper heading hierarchy (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`)
- Figure and figcaption for image descriptions
- Navigation bar using unordered list

## Challenges Faced
One major challenge was replicating an authentic newspaper layout using only HTML without modern CSS frameworks. 
Aligning floats, tables, and multi-column text while maintaining readability required careful structure and layout planning. 
This was solved by combining float clearing techniques and structured semantic grouping.
